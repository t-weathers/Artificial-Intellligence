Artificial Intelligence class from my university.

Assignment 1: "Wolves and Chickens" Problem:
- you need to cross a river with x sheep and y wolves. The boat can fit 3 people at a time, yourself, and 2 animals. You must have at least one animal with you to cross the river at all times, and most importantly, you cannot leave more wolves than chickens on either side of the riverbank at any times or they will be eaten. Solve for the quickest set of moves to cross the river with all the animals. 

- Use "Modes" for this program, where the user can select which search algorithm to use to search through the possible move sets:
breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative-deepening depth-first search, and A* Search

- return the move sequence for that game in a text file
